You just need to use forward declaration correctly:

Put all code in cpp files
Put just class declaration in header file
In header file:
    Use forward declaration if you only use a pointer or a reference.
    Otherwise you to include header file. (Do Not add unrequired includes)
In cpp file
    include all header files you require.
